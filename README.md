## Debugging Practice Scenario 3 - Inline Editing

When a user clicks on a pre-existing expense, we want to be able to update that single value for the expense when they hit the ENTER key. When we first start up this branch, we can see that we're not even getting our pre-defined expenses rendered to the DOM. Figure out why, then try out the inline editing. Spoiler alert, it's not going to work. When you do get it working, we should see a success notification appear at the top of the page that's highlighted green. It doesn't seem to have a background color on it at the moment. Fix it!
